## Important

### Make sure

1. You have docker installed
2. You have node installed
3. You have provided the correct RPC
4. You have `graph-cli` installed

### Networks and start block
In `subgraph.yaml` you can find the networks you want to listen to. You need to provide the start block for the network you want to listen to. Also, you can provide the subgraph name and the contract address. Final step is change `networks.json` to the network you want to listen to.

In `docker-compose.yml` you need to change `ethereum` value to the network you want to listen to and provide the correct RPC.



## Handlers
In `src/mapping.ts` you can find the handlers for the events. You can add more handlers for the events you want to listen to.

## Installing graph-cli

```bash
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### for the scratch setup
```bash
$ graph init
```
